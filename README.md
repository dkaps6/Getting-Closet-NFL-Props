# NFL Prop Model — Elite Turn‑Key

This repo is **turn‑key**: you can upload the contents of this folder to a fresh GitHub repo,
add one Actions secret (`ODDS_API_KEY`), and run the workflow **Full Slate: Lines + Features + Model**.
It will fetch lines (optional), build features, run the model, and upload outputs.
